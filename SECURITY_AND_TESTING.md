# Security and Testing Guide

## Security Measures

This project implements multiple layers of security to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

### Content Sanitization

All user-generated content is sanitized using DOMPurify and custom validators to prevent:
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- SQL Injection
- Malicious URL injections

### Input Validation

Comprehensive validation is performed using Zod with additional security enhancements:
- Type checking and constraints (min/max length, patterns, etc.)
- Content sanitization during validation
- Malicious pattern detection

### Data Handling

Safe data handling practices include:
- Parameterized queries via Supabase
- Proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Content moderation workflows for user-generated content

## Testing Framework

This project uses Vitest with React Testing Library for comprehensive testing.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components, hooks, and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Security Tests**: Verify that sanitization and validation work correctly

### Test Files

Test files are located alongside the code they test with a `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extension.

### Test Utilities

- `TestRenderer.tsx`: A custom renderer that provides all necessary context providers
- `setup.ts`: Sets up test environment and mocks

## Continuous Improvement

To maintain and improve the security and test coverage:

1. Write tests for new features before implementing them (TDD approach)
2. Regularly update security measures as new threats emerge
3. Run security scanning tools (not yet implemented)
4. Perform regular code reviews focused on security

## Future Enhancements

- Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress
- Add accessibility testing
- Include security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance testing for key user flows
